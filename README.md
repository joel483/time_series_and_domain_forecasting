# Summary

I implemented a time series forecast with the library Prophet to analyse the fuel price at Walmart.

The U.S. gas station industry had a gross output of more than 94 billion dollars. Fuel prices seem to fluctuate in the short term and not be stable all year long. Based on historical Walmart data, this analysis forecast the price of the fuel at the same company for the next 90 days and the next year coming.
